# Machine-Learning-based-grade-prediction
Machine Learning based student final grade prediction and analysis

Using different Machine Learning techniques to use data about the student's performance at the beginning of the course to predict the final grade of the student. The tools used are as follows:<br/>
* Scikit-learn
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

The Machine Learning algorithms used for the prediction are as follows:
* Random Forest Classification
* Support Vector Machine Classification
